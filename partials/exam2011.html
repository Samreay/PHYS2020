            <ol type="a">
                <li>Give thermodynamic definitions of the terms <i>temperature</i> and <i>thermal equilibrium</i>. Describe the significance of the zeroth law of thermodynamics.</li>
                <li>Give a statement of the second law of thermodynamics that is applicable to adiabatically isolated systems. Generalise this statement for systems with diathermal boundaries.</li>

        <li>
            <p>Temperature is that which is the same for two objects in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium is the state when two objects in thermal contact no longer have spontaneous energy flow. The zeroth law states that temperature is transitive. If you are A and B are in thermal equilibrium, and B and C are in thermal equilibrium, then A and C are in thermal equilibrium.</p>

        <li>
           <p>Entropy cannot decrease. If we generalise this to the universe, cannot decrease.</p>

        <h5><strong>Question 2:</strong>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Starting from the fundamental equation of thermodynamics and treating internal energy as a function of volume and temperature $U=U(T,V)$, derive the following general expression for a change in entropy: $$dS = \frac{C_V}{T} dT + \frac{1}{T} (\pi_T + p) dV$$</li>
                <li>Is it always true that the entropy must increase with volume (at constant temperature)? In your answer, discuss the case of an ideal gas versus that of a real gas.</li>
            </ol>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>So, let us start the the thermodynamic identity and work towards the result we want.</p>
            <p>\begin{eqnarray*}
                dU &=& T dS - P dV \\
                dS &=& \frac{1}{T} dU - \frac{P}{T} dV \\
                &=& \frac{1}{T} \left(\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V dT +  \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T dV \right)  - \frac{P}{T} dV \\
                &=& \frac{1}{T} \left(C_V dT +  \pi_T dV \right)  - \frac{P}{T} dV \\
                &=& \frac{C_V}{T} dT + \frac{1}{T}(\pi_T + P) dV
                \end{eqnarray*}</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>From the above, we can see that at constant temperature the change in entropy is $dS = \frac{1}{T}(\pi_T + P) dV$. Thus, the only way to get a decrease in entropy is we increase volume is for $\pi_T + P < 0$. However, an ideal gas has $\pi_T = 0, p > 0$, so entropy must always increase. For a real gas though, if attractive forces are dominating we will have $\pi_T < 0$. If that is sufficient to make $\pi_T + P < 0$ then we would get a decrease in entropy on expansion.

        <h5><strong>Question 3:</strong>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>An icecube, weighing 25g, is brought out from a freezer (-18 degrees) and left to melt on a kitchen bench at room temperature (25 degrees). Calculate the change in entropy of the ice/water as it comes to thermal equilibrium with the kitchen bench. Take the moral heat capacity of ice to be $C_{p,m} = 38.0\;\mathrm{J/K/mol}$.</li>
                <li>What is the entropy change of the surroundings during this process? Explan how your results in part (a) and (b) are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.</li>
            </ol>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>So we will have three ways entropy increases in the icecube: heating the ice, melting it, and then heating the water. Note that this exam has another page after the formula sheets which has all the values you need.</p>
            <p>\begin{eqnarray*}
                \Delta S &=& \Delta S_i + \Delta S_m + \Delta S_l \\
                \Delta S &=& n C_P(s) \ln \frac{T_m}{T_i} + \frac{\Delta_l H}{T_m} + n C_P(l) \ln \frac{T_f}{T_m} \\
                \Delta S &=& \frac{25}{18} \left( (38.0 \;\mathrm{J/K/mol}) \cdot \ln \frac{273}{273-18} + \frac{(6008\;\mathrm{J/mol})}{273 \;\mathrm{K}} + (75.29 \;\mathrm{J/K/mol}) \ln \frac{273+25}{273} \right)\\
                \Delta S &=& 43.3 \;\mathrm{J/K}
                \end{eqnarray*}</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>So for the entropy change in the environment, we can consider it to be a reservoir that does not change temperature. As such, $\Delta S = \frac{Q}{T}$.</p>
            <p>\begin{eqnarray*}
                \Delta S &=& \frac{Q}{T} \\
                &=& \frac{n(C_P(s) \Delta T_1 + \Delta_l H + C_P(l) \Delta T_2)}{T} \\
                &=& \frac{-(\frac{25}{18} \;\mathrm{mol}) \cdot ((38.0 \;\mathrm{J/K/mol})\cdot(18 \;\mathrm{K}) + (6008 \;\mathrm{J/mol}) + (75.29 \;\mathrm{J/K/mol})\cdot(25 \;\mathrm{K})  )}{273+25 \;\mathrm{K}} \\
                &=& -39.96 \;\mathrm{J/K}
                \end{eqnarray*}</p>
            <p>Well, second law of thermodynamics says if you find the entropy of the universe decrease, you've screwed something up. Luckily, we find in this case that the total entropy change of the universe is $\Delta S = 43.3 - 40 = 3.3\;\mathrm{J/K}$ which is still an increase. Which is good.</p>

        <h5><strong>Question 4:</strong> Consider the process of photosynthesis, the process by which a planet uses the energy of sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose (with oxygen as a byproduct), according to the reaction: $$6CO_2(g) + 6H_2O(l) \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6(s) + 6O_2(g)$$.

        <li>
            <p>For a reaction to be spontaneous, we have to have a decrease in Gibbs free energy. We can find the change in Gibbs free energy by simply subtracting the consistuents of the reaction. From Schoeder, we have that:</p>

            </table>
            <p>Now, to actually subtract these values:</p>
            <p>\begin{eqnarray*}
                \Delta G &=& 6 \Delta_g CO_2 + 6 \Delta_g H_2O - (\Delta_g C_6H_{12}O_6(s) +  6 \Delta_g O_2) \\
                &=& [6(394.36+237.13) - 910 ] \;\mathrm{kJ/mol}\\
                &=& 2879 \;\mathrm{kJ/mol}
                \end{eqnarray*}</p>
            <p>Thus, the minimum amount of work that has to be done to make one mole of glucose is to supply approximately 2880 kJ of energy to the reaction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Right, now subtracting entropy instead of Gibbs free energy:</p>
            <p>\begin{eqnarray*}
                \Delta S &=& 6 \Delta_s CO_2 + 6 \Delta_s H_2O - (\Delta_s C_6H_{12}O_6(s) +  6 \Delta_s O_2) \\
                &=& [6\cdot(-188.3-213.73+205.14) + 212] \;\mathrm{kJ/mol}\\
                &=& -972.52 \;\mathrm{kJ/mol}
                \end{eqnarray*}</p>
            <p>Entropy decreases with this reaction. In order for the second law not to be broken, the entropy external to the system must increase at least as much as the entropy of the reaction decreased. The way to increase the entropy of the external system is if the reaction gives off heat.</p>
